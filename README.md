# js2016 - Lazer

Compo entry for http://js1k.com/2016-elemental/, demo url: http://js1k.com/2016-elemental/demo/2550

Random Notes:
- Regpack reduce the framerate from 45fps to 23fps (ff45) [only if "withMath" option is enabled - this saves 5 bytes]
- Canons alpha values looks different in ff45 and chrome49 ("rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.006)")
- Mobile browser also looks different, planet alpha value and canon alpha value are almost invisible
- Optimized for Chrome 49/Safari 9 on desktop - but works on other browsers too
